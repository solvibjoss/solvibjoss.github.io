![crime][def]

This tells us that Lebanon and Kuwait people have the most trouble with the law with over . The residents of Lebanon is complicated as it is belived that 2/3 of the immigrants are stateless [Palestians](https://vb.is/skodun/kostnadur-vegna-innflytjenda-danmork-og-sosialistar/)

Now we are interested to know what type of crimes the two countries have been committing the most.
![crime][kule]
"Road Traffic Act, other" leads as the most frequent crime in both Kuwait and Lebanon. Following closely in both countries are "Shoplifting, etc.," "Euphoriants Act," and "Other special laws," which occupy the next three positions, respectively. However, the fifth most common crime diverges; in Kuwait, it is "Common assault," whereas in Lebanon, it is the "Firearms Act." This indicates notable similarities in the crime patterns of both countries, albeit with some variations in specific types of less frequent crimes.
